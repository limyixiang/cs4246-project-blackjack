1. need to add actions 
  - split
  - double
  - surrender
2. need to determine the optimal number of train episodes for train and bet 
3. write test files for all variants to confirm that the environment is working as expected
4. future work could explore having more players in the game, and these players take random actions
  - currently assume only 1 player and 1 dealer
5. bust on hit assumes that dealer does not reveal the card, which could be the cause of the abnormal results
6. update surrender logic --- dealer hole card only revealed if he has a blackjack

---

current implementation
dealer hits on soft 17 (better for the dealer --- Player EV impact -0.2%)
double after split is allowed
surrender after split is not allowed
max splits is 4
decks in a game is 4
ace splitting: only 1 split allowed

---
split logic:
player: [8,8] -> can split into 2 hands: [8,1] and [8,2]
play first hand
when first hand ends, observation of next hand is passed as observation
if split aces [A,A] then the each hand is immediately dealt one more card and the hands should be resolved immediately
if bust on split hand: immediately pay out
if stick on non-busted hand: wait for dealer's hand resolution

test immediate pay out vs accumulate rewards at end of episode

need to check if rewards are accumulated
  - immediate pay off if bust on split hand
  - need to check if final rewards for the episode include the pay out from busted

test:
1. original configuration (immediate bust, dealer does not show card)
2. trend with additions of actions
3. delayed bust, dealer does not show card
4. immediate bust, dealer shows card (full information)
5. difference between random policy
6. vary penetration
